These figures come from paper “Physics-informed multi-source data fusion for inferencing residual stress field of rotary parts” by Haonan Guo, Yingguang Li*, Changqing Liua Dong He and Kai Tang. If you have any questions, please email us: guohaonan@nuaaa.edu.cn.
5000 sets of residual stress field data are stored in the file “xishunew.npy”. The corresponding 5000 sets of deformation force data are stored in “bxlnew.npy”. We have documented the usage of two files in file “Readdata”.
The residual stress data measured by the contour method and how to use it are stored in the file” countermethod.py”.
